          <p>Use the keyboard to move Fireboy and Watergirl through the maze and collect the diamonds on their way to the exits. The A,W,D keys move Watergirl and the arrow keys move Fireboy. Since fire and water don't mix, be sure to not let Fireboy go in the water lakes and don't let Watergirl go in the fire lakes... And keep them both out of the green lakes.</p>

		  <p>In each temple the boy and girl must run and jump between fire and water, you should know that Fireboy is immune to fire, so he can step freely in pools of boiling lava, but he must be careful from stepping into water. Watergirl is resistant to pools of water, but gets hurt when stepping in the lava. Both charachters should beware of any other puddle on the way (green or black). At each screen the goal is to get to the doors which will lead you to the next room in the temple. The Fireboy should come to the door marked in red and the Watergirl should find her way to the door marked with a blue sign. On their way, both characters should collect diamonds that have the same color as themselves. In stages marked with a diamond, both girl and boy should collect the green diamond. The faster you get to the doors of each screen the higher score and ranking you will get.</p>
